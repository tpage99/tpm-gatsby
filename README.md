# Gatsby is awesome

A static site generator that uses React! How cool is that? It's proven to be a great introduction to React, as well as a practical use for GraphQL. Initially, I left this markdown alone from the initial deploy with the Gatsby starter, but I heard Wes Bos talk about using markdown files to make notes to himself. So that's what I'm going to start doing! 

## Gatsby Resources

Gatsby is an excellent tool with tons of documentation on their own site, [Gatsby Home Page](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), but I've found a lot of good examples and tutorials for Gatsby along the way.
