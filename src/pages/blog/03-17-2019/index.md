Purpose: There's tons of information online about marketing through social media and the best way to enhance your business by using these platforms. Quite frankly, it can be a little overwhelming. To help simplify, we'll use this short series to discuss a few key strategies that we've found to be successful in Facebook marketing. 

## Use Facebook Insights to Get Important Information About Your Audience

First off, you need a business page for your business' Facebook. Personal pages are very limited and are not designed to give you or your audience the sort of access and tools you will need to reach potential customers. Facebook Insights is free to you, provided you have a business page for your Facebook page, and provides data that is incredibly useful. Once you've created a business page you will be able to access the "Insights" tab near the top of the page underneath the search bar on a computer or at the bottom of the page if you're using the Facebook Pages Manager app. Bear in mind, you are best off to access Facebook Insights from a computer as on a mobile device the view and data is limited. 

Once you select the Insights tab, you'll have a host of data available to you. Anytime we work on a Facebook Page, one of the first things we do is examine the population of the page - gender, age, location, and time the page is most visited - to help us gain insight into our audience. When you determine key demographics about your population, this helps you craft posts and target ads specifically for this population (stay tuned for this part of the series!).

 Since Facebook uses an algorithm (basically a set of rules it follows) to show content to your followers, this helps you to leverage the algorithm to work for you! So, for example, if you know that your page has the most views between 2-3 PM, then scheduling a post within this time frame will be more effective because this is when most people are already there. If your largest population is women who are ages 50-65, then this gives you some ideas for the types of posts that would be most engaging. By understanding your population, you can more effectively cater content specifically to them, which is the best way to get your unpaid posts seen by more people. Better marketing for free - isn't that what we all want?!
