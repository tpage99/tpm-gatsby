Wordpress is a great tool. I bet you didn't expect that as the first sentence, given the title. But it's true. Wordpress has been around for a while and has been the best option for individuals and small businesses who want a website without having to know much code. With it, you can create great websites that have dynamic content (content that changes or updates, such as blogs or interactions with users on the page). Through plugins you can have access to a host of pre-configured commands that help eliminate the need for you to write a single line of code. 

So why is it not the solution we recommend for most small businesses? Let's break this down.

## Security

Wordpress powers over 30% of the World Wide Web according to [W3 Techs](https://w3techs.com/), a company that collects information about the technologies that power the web and makes results publicly available, and as such is the most popular Content Management System (CMS) out there. Because Wordpress is so popular it becomes the primary target for a lot of hackers. Even if you know only a little bit of code, it's very easy to determine if a site is built with Wordpress. Knowing how your website is built puts hackers at the front door of your website instantly. 

If you currently use Wordpress as your website solution, we encourage you to spend some time making sure you're doing what you can to address security concerns. Simply Googling how to do this and following some steps is a good start but you can also check out this link from [wpbeginner](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-security/) for a step-by-step guide on how to secure your Wordpress site. To be clear there's no solution that will make your website invulnerable to attacks from bots and hackers, but Wordpress is certainly one of the most vulnerable.

## Speed

Google uses page speed as a factor in ranking mobile search results, [according to their official blog](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search.html). Wordpress itself is not necessarily slow, but a host of issues can cause your Wordpress site to run slower or appear to load slowly to your customers, such as poorly structured themes, hosting, poorly configured plugins, and the unnecessary bloat that comes with using a CMS and not having to write any code yourself. Slow to load pages hurts your results when people go to look you up in search engines like Google and people often leave a website if it is slow to load. 

## Cost

And this one is a biggie. Although Wordpress itself is free and open source, if you're going with the self-hosted option, the costs associated with themes, hosting, and the necessity for oversight because of the security vulnerabilities make it costly. Wordpress is often touted as a cheap solution for businesses to make a website because you don't have to hire a web developer, but the ongoing cost adds up. Sure, you can get some shared hosting for relatively cheap - but the issue with shared hosting is that you SHARE your website's server with other users. Other users who may not be as security-conscious as you. So all your efforts are wasted on trying to make sure you have a site that isn't easily exposed by hackers, since they can gain access to your site through another user on your shared server. And if you're having to spend the time being diligent about updating plugins and monitoring known plugin vulnerabilities online so your site can stay functional, you're wasting time optimizing your website when you should be able to spend that time optimizing your business. 

## The Solution

So if Wordpress is problematic because of issues with security, speed, and cost - what is the alternative? We build sites using the JAMstack. The "JAM" in JAMstack stands for Javascript, APIs, and Markup. Stack just refers to the technologies used to build the website. You can learn a little more about it at the [JAMstack website](https://jamstack.org/), but basically these sites have better performance, are cheap to host, and are considered significantly more secure than using a CMS. These create very fast to load static websites, which means they will rank better in search and be more appealing to customers who are looking at your website. 

Don't get me wrong, Wordpress is great and is a viable solution for some. It's just not the go-to it used to be due to emerging technologies like static site generators (SSGs), such as my favorite [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), that help build sites that are "blazing fast." You no longer NEED Wordpress if you want a blog, as we can still create a secure and fast JAMstack site that will give you access to an editor that doesn't require you to know code. Or if you just need a simple brochure site with one or two pages, there's no reason to take on the security, speed, and cost issues of Wordpress when a simple site in HTML, CSS, and Javascript would work much better. Use the right tool, for the right job.
