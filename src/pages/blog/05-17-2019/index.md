Our third and final post in this series! We covered using Facebook insights to identify and cater to your customer base in [part 1](https://www.thepagesmedia.com/blog/using-facebook-as-a-marketing-tool-part-1). We also discussed how to use Targeted Ads on Facebook to more accurately reach your identified customers in [part 2](https://www.thepagesmedia.com/blog/using-facebook-as-a-marketing-tool-part-2). What else do we think is super effective when managing a Business Page on Facebook?

#### Drum roll please

## Be responsive to the customers on your page

That feels obvious, right? I mean, who doesn't know that you should respond when people have a question? Well, you'd be surprised. Facebook pages everywhere are rife with unanswered customer questions and negative feedback that hasn't been addressed. In this new era of digital communications, sometimes it feels like customer services is an outdated concept. But here's the thing - people still really appreciate it. 

For the last several years, big corporations have run the show but what we've seen lately is a push, even from big box stores, for an optimal and personal experience for every customer where they feel valued and heard. And that means that solid customer service is making a huge comeback. Ultimately, people desire to be understood and appreciated because it makes them feel more connected. There are a couple of reasons why this is important

### When people feel connected and valued they are more likely to be a repeat customer.

Think back to a time when you had a great experience with a customer service representative. What do you remember? Likely, they validated you, were extremely helpful, friendly, and sought to understand what it was you needed. Now think of a horrible customer experience. What comes to mind? For us, it's rude customer service agents who consistently repeat the same line out of a training manual and pretend that there's nothing they can do when it's clear there's plenty to be done. Now, which of those two businesses would you be more likely to interact with again? Probably the first. The reality is that people still like nice people, so even if you pump out a quality product but you aren't responsive or overly helpful to your customer, they probably won't return to you. This tells us that there's more to business than just a quality product (which, obviously, is also necessary).

### When you connect with your customers, they're more likely to offer you grace.

Nobody is on all the time, so it's impossible to suggest that customers will have an optimal experience with your business every single time. But when you are consistently responsive and appreciative of your customers you build loyalty. When a customer has had an overwhelmingly positive experience the last 20 times they've interacted with you, they won't be too concerned if they have one odd or awkward encounter because they will know that this isn't common for your business. You want that kind of loyalty because you know what those customers do? They tell other people about you. And when someone suggests something negative, they advocate for you. You create an army of customers, so to speak, who will be vocal about their allegiance to your company. 

This concept is so basic and so simple to complete. When someone leaves a comment that needs a response, respond in a reasonable time frame (we suggest 24 hours). If a customer messages you for information and you need to follow up with somebody else, let them know that and then be sure to get back to them when you have the needed information. When a client notes a positive experience, use that opportunity to thank them and tell them how much you appreciate their business! 

On the converse, if someone feels like they've been treated unfairly or hasn't had that great of an experience, don't be defensive. Apologize, gather information, and work to rectify the situation in an appropriate manner. Use this opportunity to enhance and improve your business practices. Remember, you are working towards longevity here; you want a loyal customer base that will stick with you as you grow.

Regardless of the social media platform you use (stay tuned for a blog post on how to choose the best platform for your business), quality and consistent customer response is a highly valuable tool to expand your business and create that loyal customer base you're looking for.
